# WEATHER-APP
The Weather App is a web-based project that provides real-time weather updates for any city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a clean interface, fast API integration, and error handling for invalid inputs.
